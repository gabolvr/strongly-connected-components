# Finding Strongly Connected Components

The goal of this project is to implement a sequential and a parallel program that identifies the strongly connected components of a directed graph (*digraphs*), as well as to generate Erdõs-Rényi (ER) digraphs.

Programming project for the course INF442 (*Traitement des données massives*) at École Polytechnique.
