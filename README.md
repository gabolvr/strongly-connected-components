# Finding Strongly Connected Components

The goal of this project is to implement a sequential and a parallel program that identifies the strongly connected components of a directed graph (*digraphs*), as well as to generate Erdõs-Rényi (ER) digraphs.

Programming project for the course INF442 (*Traitement des données massives*) at École Polytechnique.


## Quick Description
  1. ER_graph_seq: Generates an Erdos-Renyi graph
  2. format_graph.txt: explains the format used for representing the graph in a file
  3. parameter.er: file with parameters for ER_graph
  4. sanitize.sh: cleans the directory, removing any randomly generated graphs
  5. seq_scc: sequential implementation of the Kosaraju`s algorithm to find Strongly Connected components
  6. \*.graph: example of graph files
  7. \*.rgraph: graphs generated by the ER_graph code
